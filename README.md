# image-classification
This is the image classification problem based notebook in which the model has to differentiate between 5 classes of animals.

In this i am importing the data of zip file from the google drive's shared link. The data is in zip format having three files/folders in it.
1) train folder
2) test folder
3) submission file format 
test folder and submission file format is not of your's need.
The train folder has 5 folder of 5 different categories of animals for classification having images of the particular type of animal.


### Note :--
In this i am not used any famous or fancy models to train the model.

If anyone face any kind of difficultiy in loading the data, feel free to comment so that i can provide you the same.
If anyone wants to give any kind of suggestion or having difficulity to understand any point, feel free to comment. I will be happy to have your thoughts on that..
